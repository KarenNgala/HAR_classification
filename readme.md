# Classification Analysis of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a classification analysis on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset. The analysis aims to classify different physical activities based on smartphone sensor data.

## Project Overview
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository explores the Human Activity Recognition dataset and applies classification models to achieve specific objectives.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones). It includes smartphone sensor data that capture various human activities such as walking, sitting, and standing.
- Create **datasets/** Folder for storing the extracted csv file.


## Requirements
Before running the Notebook, make sure to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (replace 'venv' with your preferred environment name)
python -m venv virtual


# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
virtual\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux
source virtual/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies
```bash
# Install the required packages using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
